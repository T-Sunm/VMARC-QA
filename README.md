## 📖 Introduction

This is the official implementation of the paper **"A knowledge-based multi-agent approach for Vietnamese VQA with rationale explanations"**.

Visual Question Answering with Natural Language Explanations (VQA-NLE) is a major challenge for AI, especially for the Vietnamese language due to a lack of specialized datasets and methods.

**VMARC-QA** (Vietnamese Multi-Agent Rationale-driven Consensus for Question Answering) is a framework designed to solve this problem. Our system uses a team of AI agents working in parallel to gather evidence, form a logical explanation, and ultimately derive a final answer.

The core features of VMARC-QA include:

* **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Employs an ensemble of three distinct agents (Junior, Senior, Manager) that work in parallel to gather evidence using different tools and perspectives.
* **Verifiable Reasoning**: Implements an "evidence-to-rationale" process, ensuring that every explanation is grounded in the evidence collected by the agents, rather than being freely hallucinated.
* **Reliable Consensus**: Aggregates agent outputs through a dual-stream mechanism: weighted voting determines the best answer, while a semantic consistency check on the rationales ensures the final output is coherent and trustworthy.

On the **ViVQA-X** benchmark, VMARC-QA sets a new standard for answer accuracy while maintaining top-tier explanation quality:

* 🏆 : Achieves **64.8%** answer accuracy, outperforming strong prior models like NLX-GPT by over **11 percentage points**.
* ✍️ : Produces explanations with high semantic fidelity, confirmed by a highly competitive **BERTScore of 76.0**, nearly matching the specialized fine-tuned model NLX-GPT (76.3).

The overall architecture of VMARC-QA is shown in the figure below:

## 🚀 Quick Start

This guide helps you set up the necessary environments to run VMARC-QA.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and its submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules [https://github.com/T-Sunm/VMARC-QA.git](https://github.com/T-Sunm/VMARC-QA.git)
cd VMARC-QA

# 2. Set up the main environment (for the LangGraph framework)
conda create -n vmarc-qa python=3.10 -y
conda activate vmarc-qa
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set up the tool environment (for the ViVQA-X model)
# (Execute from the project's root directory)
cd ViVQA-X
conda create -n vmarc-qa-tool python=3.10 -y
conda activate vmarc-qa-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] python-multipart
cd ..
```

## ⚙️ Installation

This section provides a detailed step-by-step guide to setting up the entire project.

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Conda**: For managing isolated environments.
- **Python 3.10+**
- **API Keys**: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your API keys (if you plan to use services like OpenAI, Wikipedia, etc.).

### 2. Environment Setup
Follow the steps in the [🚀 Quick Start](#-quick-start) section to install the two required conda environments: `vmarc-qa` and `vmarc-qa-tool`.

## 📦 Data Preparation

VMARC-QA is evaluated on the **ViVQA-X** dataset, which uses images from MS COCO 2014.

### 1. Download COCO 2014 Images

Create a `data` directory and download the `val2014` image set:

```bash
# Create the directory structure
mkdir -p data/COCO_Images data/ViVQA-X

# Download and unzip the Validation 2014 images (~6GB)
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip -P data/
unzip data/val2014.zip -d data/COCO_Images/
rm data/val2014.zip
```

### 2. Set Up ViVQA-X Annotations
Copy the required annotation files from the submodule into your data directory:

```bash
# Copy the annotation file from the submodule
cp ViVQA-X/data/final/ViVQA-X_test.json data/ViVQA-X/
```

### 3. Final Directory Structure
Your data directory structure should look like this when you're done:

```
Visual-Multi-Agent-Knowledge-QA-/
├── data/
│   ├── COCO_Images/
│   │   └── val2014/
│   │       ├── COCO_val2014_000000000042.jpg
│   │       └── ...
│   └── ViVQA-X/
│       └── ViVQA-X_test.json
```

## ▶️ Usage
The VMARC-QA system consists of multiple components. Follow these steps to run a full experiment.

### Step 1: Run the VQA Tool Server

Open a terminal, activate the `vmarc-qa-tool` environment, and start the API server from the **ViVQA-X** submodule directory.

```bash
conda activate vmarc-qa-tool
cd ViVQA-X/api
python main.py
```

This server provides the **Aligned Candidate Generator** tool to the agents.

### Step 2: Run the LLM Server (Optional, for local models)

If you are using a local LLM with VLLM, open a new terminal, activate the `vmarc-qa` environment, and start the server. The following is an example for the **Qwen** model:

```bash
conda activate vmarc-qa

# Command to serve a local LLM with VLLM
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B \
    --port 1234 \
    --dtype auto \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.5 \
    --max-model-len 4096 \
    --trust-remote-code
```

### Step 3: Run the Main Experiment

Once the servers are ready, open another new terminal, activate the `vmarc-qa` environment, and run the main experiment script.

**Configuration:** Open the `scripts/full_system.sh` file to customize your run:

* **SAMPLES**: Set the number of samples to run. Set to `0` to run on the entire test set.
* **TEST\_JSON\_PATH** and **TEST\_IMAGE\_DIR**: By default, the script looks for data in the `data/` directory. You can uncomment and modify these paths if your data is stored elsewhere.

**Execution:**

```bash
conda activate vmarc-qa
bash scripts/full_system.sh
```
